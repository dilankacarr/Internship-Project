# Internship-Project
I've done this project at my first internship program on July of 2023.At this project I used the Spring Boot framework and created REST API. Initially, I obtained household details by household ID, followed by people residing in those households and their trip legs. My objective was to access people and their respective trip legs via household ID. The REST API and some of its codes are presented below for reference you can also see the CRUD operations I used.
